# Side Project
This is my repository for my "Mans go Neow" project, 
the sixth project that I made during Base Camp Coding Academy.

## Mans_go_NEOW
Mans go NEOW is my twist on the Pygame tutorial project.
In one of the earlier parts of the tutorial, the avatar was first a red rectangle that could move in all directions.
I took that part of the tutorial and starting playing around with variables.
Later in the tutorial, there is a shooting mechanic that can shoot left or right.
I took that mechanic and made it shoot left, right, up, and down using the arrow keys.
